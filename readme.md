Expense Manager with AngularJS, SharePoint/Office 365 and Windows Azure Active Directory (WAAD)
===============

If youâ€™re new to AngularJS check out the [AngularJS in 60-ish Minutes](http://weblogs.asp.net/dwahlin/video-tutorial-angularjs-fundamentals-in-60-ish-minutes) video tutorial or download the [free eBook](http://weblogs.asp.net/dwahlin/angularjs-in-60-ish-minutes-the-ebook). Also check out [The AngularJS Magazine](http://flip.it/bdyUX) for up-to-date information on using AngularJS to build Single Page Applications (SPAs).

This application is a stand-alone AngularJS application that performs CRUD operations against SharePoint/Office 365. Authentication relies on Windows Azure Active Directory (WAAD).
This application demonstrates:

* Consuming data provided by SharePoint/Office 365 RESTful APIs
* Authentication against Windows Azure Active Directory (WAAD)
* A custom "middle-man" proxy that allows cross-domain calls to be made to SharePoint/Office 365
* A complete application with read-only and editable data
* Using AngularJS with $http in a factory to access a backend RESTful service
* Techniques for showing multiple views of data (card view and list view)
* Custom filters for filtering customer and product data
* A custom directive to ensure unique values in a form for email 
* A custom directive that intercepts $http and jQuery XHR requests (in case either are used) and displays a loading dialog
* A custom directive that handles highlighting menu items automatically based upon the path navigated to by the user
* Form validation using AngularJS

#Prerequisites

* Azure subscription (trial will work)
* Office 365 tenant
* SharePoint site collection in your Office 365 tenant

#Office 365 and SharePoint Setup

1. Upload the ExpensesTrackerSiteTemplate.wsp template into an existing Office 365/SharePoint site collection solution folder. Then create a Site instance within that site collection based on that site template called "Expense Tracker Site Template". This will create an Expenses site with 3 lists for employees, expenses, and states.
